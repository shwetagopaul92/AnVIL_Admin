## About _Bioconductor_ and _AnVIL_

[_Bioconductor_][] is a successful open-source project for the
statistical analysis and comprehension of high throughput genomic
data. _Bioconductor_ is based on the _R_ programming language. It
consists of more than 1600 [_R_ packages][] contributed by more than
1000 maintainers world-wide. _Bioconductor_ packages are downloaded to 1/2
million IP addresses annualy. There are more than 29,000
[PubMedCentral citations][] to _Bioconductor_. _Bioconductor_ has an
active [support site][] and [community slack][].

[_AnVIL_][] is a US National Institutes of Health / National Human
Genome Research Institute initiative to develop a Genomic Data Science
Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL).

Ultimately, _AnVIL_ will provide the ability to launch RStudio,
Jupyter notebook, and other _R_ / _Bioconductor_ resources in a
computational cloud. The _AnVIL_ environment will provide secure access
to large-scale as well as individual data resources, and to scalable
cloud-based computational environments.
